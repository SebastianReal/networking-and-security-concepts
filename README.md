# Networking and Security Concepts

This repository contains fundamental notes, visual guides, and technical explanations covering key areas in computer networking and cybersecurity.

## Structure

- **Security_Models**: Notes and comparisons of theoretical models like Bell-LaPadula and Microsoft Tiered Administration.
- **OSI_Protection_Mechanisms**: Layer-by-layer breakdown of the OSI model and security tools applied at each level (e.g., WAFs, MACsec, IDS/IPS).

## Purpose

To document and organize theoretical knowledge for reference and sharing, particularly useful for Security+ preparation, cybersecurity foundations, and portfolio development.
