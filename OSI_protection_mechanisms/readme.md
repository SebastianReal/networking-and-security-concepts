# OSI Protection Mechanisms

This folder contains layered security documentation aligned with the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. Each section presents real-world tools, technologies, and defensive strategies that can be implemented at each layer of the model to strengthen overall network security.

## Overview

The OSI model divides network communication into seven conceptual layers. This documentation maps common protection mechanisms to each layer, such as:
- Web Application Firewalls at the Application Layer
- Encryption protocols at the Presentation Layer
- IDS/IPS at the Network Layer
- Physical security practices at the Physical Layer

This layered approach helps enforce the principle of defence-in-depth and supports more resilient infrastructure design.
