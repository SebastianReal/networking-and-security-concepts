## Overview

Security models provide structured approaches to managing who can access information and under what conditions. This section explores:
- The **Bell-LaPadula Model**, which enforces confidentiality through strict access levels (e.g., “no read up, no write down”)
- The **Microsoft Tiered Administration Model**, which segments administrative access based on asset sensitivity (Tier 0, 1, 2)

These models help organizations design access control strategies that reduce risk, protect sensitive data, and limit the blast radius of potential breaches.
